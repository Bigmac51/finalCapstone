○ Project Description:
The task was to modify the existing task_manager.py code to extend its functionality.
The additional functionality required varied from registering a user, adding a task, 
viewing all tasks, and viewing the current user's tasks. Using the principle of 
abstraction, refactoring, the code can be made into a more managable streamlined codebase.
